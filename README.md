# YouDown

Run YouDown.py with your version of Python 3, or simply execute it (Linux only).

### Executing YouDown.py

#### Linux

To execute YouDown.py, run the following command:

    ./YouDown.py

OR (if you have Python 3 installed)

    python3 YouDown.py

#### Windows

To execute YouDown.py, run the following command:

    python YouDown.py

In order to know what version of Python you're running, run:

    python --version

If your version of Python is 2.x, you need to install Python 3.x. If you have both versions installed, you need to run Python 3.x by typing `python3` instead of `python` in the command line.

Prerequisite downloads:

You need to have bs4, pytube, and requests installed.
In order to install these packages, run the following command:

    pip install -U -r requirements.txt

(again, run pip --version to see which version of Python it is running on.)
