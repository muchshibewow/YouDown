# YouDown

Run YouDown.py with your version of Python 3, or simply execute it (Linux only).

## Examples:
$python3 YouDown.py (If you have multiple versions of Python on your system)
OR
$python YouDown.py (If the only version of Python you have is Python 3)
OR
$./YouDown.py (Check the shebang(#!) line to see that the path matches your path)

In order to know what version of Python you're running, run:

'python --version'.

## Prerequisite downloads:

You need to have bs4, pytube, and requests installed.
In order to install these packages, run the following command:

'pip install -U -r requirements.txt'

(again, run pip --version to see which version of Python it is running on.)
